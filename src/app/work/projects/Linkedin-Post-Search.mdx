## **Description** 
- This project leverages automation and API integrations to enhance a LinkedIn builder's network. It retrieves search results based on specified terms, compiles relevant LinkedIn posts, and delivers them via email. The tool empowers the user to engage with new and relevant posts daily, expanding their professional network effectively.

## **Problem** 
- The LinkedIn Network Enhancer was developed to streamline the process of discovering and interacting with pertinent content on LinkedIn. By automating the search and retrieval of LinkedIn posts based on pre-defined keywords, this tool saves time and ensures consistent engagement with industry-relevant discussions. The system integrates Make.com, Rapid API, and Airtable to manage search terms, gather results, and automate email dispatch, thereby simplifying network building for users.

## **Key Features**

-  **Email Integration:** Compiles search results into a structured email format using a Gmail API.
-  **Airtable Hosting:** Manages search terms and results in a centralized database.
-  **Engagement Optimization:** Delivers daily email with URLs to facilitate user comments on 10 new posts.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Make.com:** For workflow automation.
- **Rapid API:** To scrape LinkedIn search results.
- **Airtable:** To host search terms and collate results.
- **Gmail API:** For automated email dispatch.

## **Challenges and Learnings** 
One of the main challenges faced during the development was constructing the HTML table for the email format. This required a rapid acquisition of new skills to ensure the results were presented clearly and effectively. Overcoming this challenge was a significant learning experience that broadened the developer's skill set in HTML and email integration.

## **Outcome** 
The LinkedIn Network Enhancer successfully facilitated increased engagement and networking on LinkedIn. By automating the search and response process, it enabled the user to expand their professional connections and stay active within their industry community. This project not only demonstrated technical proficiency in API integration and automation but also highlighted the impact of strategic engagement on professional growth.
