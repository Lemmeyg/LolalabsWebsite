## **Description** 
- This project involved creating an AI chatbot specifically for a marketing company's website. The chatbot is designed to reflect the personality of the agency's founder, engaging website visitors effectively. Utilizing OpenAI's Assistant as the language model, the chatbot serves as a top-of-funnel marketing tool that encourages visitors to initiate appointments with a company representative, increasing potential leads.

## **Problem Statement** 
- Marketing companies often struggle to sustain visitor engagement on their websites. Traditional static content does not address seekers' immediate questions or encourage subsequent interactions. To tackle this, I developed the Agency Website Chatbot to automate interactions, provide relevant responses, and steer visitors towards booking appointments with agency reps.

## **Key Features**
- **Personalized Responses:** The chatbot uses the founder's persona to create a friendly and relatable interaction experience for potential clients.
- **Seamless Integration:** Built as a WordPress add-on, minimizing the need for continuous website code updates.
- **Appointment Encouragement:** Effectively persuades visitors to set up appointments based on their inquiries and needs.
- **User Guidance:** Provides helpful responses aimed at nurturing leads and building client relationships.

## **Technology Used**
- **OpenAI Assistant:** Drives conversations with advanced natural language processing.
- **WordPress Chatbot Add-on:** An interface for easy integration into agency websites.
  
## **Challenges and Learnings** 
- Developing the chatbot required overcoming the constraint of not directly modifying website code, which posed integration challenges. I built the chatbot directly in OpenAIâ€™s ecosystem and created an instructional guide for the agency, detailing how to install the add-on and incorporate their OpenAI keys for activation. This process not only honed my technical writing skills but also improved my ability to develop user references for non-technical users.

## **Outcome** 
- The Agency Website Chatbot successfully improved visitor interaction rates and automated responses to frequently asked questions.

## **Notes** 
- Ongoing updates may be needed to keep accurate responses aligned with Marketing shifts and website content, ensuring consistentcy with the agency messaging.
