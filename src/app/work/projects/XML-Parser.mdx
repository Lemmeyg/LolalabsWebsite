---

## **Description** 
- This project aimed to develop an HTML application utilizing Claude to organize XML code derived from API payloads into structured tables. The application's primary focus was to facilitate fast, easy, and secure analysis of extensive datasets (13M samples), helping to uncover anomalies and insights essential for data interpretation.

## **Problem** 
- The XML Parser was created to streamline the analysis of a massive dataset without the need for sharing sensitive data samples with external AI tools, thus alleviating data security concerns. Utilization of the tool revolved around customizing it according to the specifics of the dataset to enhance usability, facilitate cleansing and distill insights while effectively managing large volumes of data.

## **Key Features**
- **Customized Organization:** Tailors the data structure of the application to align specifically with the intricacies of the dataset.
- **HTML Table Creation:** Transforms XML API payload into easily navigable tables for efficient analysis.
- **Excel Exporting:** Adds functionality to extract data tables directly into Excel for further data manipulation and observation.
- **Dynamic SQL Code Generation:** Implements a feature that generates SQL code to search within other data sources for selected fields visible in the payloads.
  
## **Tech Stack**
- **Claude:** For application development and functionality implementation.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Fundamental technologies used to build and present data structures.
- **Local Tools:** Emphasizing a low-tech approach that avoids data security issues typically associated with cloud solutions.

## **Challenges and Learnings** 
- One of the core challenges experienced during development was the necessity to create prompts for Claude without exposing any original data samples. Although this extended the development timeline, it highlighted the carrying importance of controlling sensitive data exposure while achieving a suitable output. The final results exemplified how custom applications can significantly advance analysis capabilities even under constrained conditions.

## **Outcome** 
- The XML Parser not only enabled significant progress in data analysis, helping identify anomalies, but also accelerated research efforts by an estimated two months. This approach to data customization rendered the tool not just increase in efficiency, but also greater integrity and security for handling sensitive information.

## **Notes** 
- This project is an example of the feasibility of developing task specific tools for the processing of complex datasets securely while enhancing customization. Continuous iterations acclerated the understandings of the dataset, resulting in a tightly optimized application tailored to meet specific research needs. Such adaptability showcased the potential of low-tech, custom solutions in navigating forthcoming data challenges.
